Memorandum
To: Dr. Ames
From: Emily Andrus
Subject: What I hope to learn from 514...

The purpose of this memo is to share with you what I hope to gain from 514 and some of the details on our project.

I would like to learn the basics of how a web application is created and modified. I don't feel the need to be an expert at creating
web applications, but I would like to be knowledgable in the lingo and their capabilities. When it is discussed in the workplace I want 
to be able to understand what they're talking about and have some opinion on what is being worked on. 

The skills I am learning in this class are valuable and hopefully I will be able to use them in the future.

Our project is based on a study I did while I was in Boise for my internship last summer. I used the FHWA Guidebook for Measuring 
Multi-Modal Connectivity. Our project is based on using that Guidebook to measure connectivity in any city in Utah. I think connectivity
for transport other than cars will be an important characteristic in the future of transportation, and this app could help measure it.
